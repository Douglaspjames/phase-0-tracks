# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
Linux assumes that users are already computer literate. It allows more access to make changes and interact with the operating system. This also allows users to potentially make mistakes and destroy the OS. It's free. It's reliable.



# In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
It's a chunk of memory, walled off and pretending to be a computer. The advantages are that it's cheap and more stable.


# Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Because there are security concerns. It's more secure to create a user and run programs from that profile.
